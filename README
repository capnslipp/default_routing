DefaultRouting
==============

This is an SEO Optimization plugin that allows you to specify that one or more nested routes will not have
a path segment added to their url.

When combined with acts_as_url_param (or some other pretty url plugin), this results in nice tight urls without any extra folders in them in the cases where you can safely get away with it.

It's important to note that using a default nesting results in a url collision that hides the index action of the nested resource. This is usually fine, because the show action of the parent resource can and should acts as the index page, and in some cases is desirable so that you don't have to remember which named route to use.

Example
=======

map.namespace :forum do |forum|
  forum.resources :boards, :default => true do |boards|
    boards.resources :threads, :default => true do |threads|
      threads.resources :posts, :default => true
    end
  end
end
